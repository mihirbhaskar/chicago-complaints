# Chicago Police Violence - Data Mining Project
Data Mining project - police use-of-force

## Notes and instructions
- Code files are suffixed by a number, which indicates the order in which they should be run
- Each code file has a standardised header which describes: the title, primary author, date of creation, and notes about what happens in the file. This should capture; the datasets that are imported or sourced, briefly how they are processed, and any files created or exported by the script.
- Paths are standardised using the 'pyprojroot' library's `here` function. The `here` function takes the user to the base of the GitHub repository automatically, regardless of their individual system's specific path.
- Several additional libraries are used as part of the code, and may need to be installed. A list of these libraries is below.
- In the data folder, all datasets are cleaned or processed in some way unless they are in the 'raw' folder

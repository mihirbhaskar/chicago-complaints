## Notes and instructions
- Code files are suffixed by a number, which indicates the order in which they should be run
- Each code file has a standardised header which describes: the title, primary author, date of creation, and notes about what happens in the file. This captures the datasets that are imported or sourced, briefly how they are processed, and any files created or exported by the script.
- Paths are standardised using the 'pyprojroot' library's `here` function. The `here` function takes the user to the base of the GitHub repository automatically, regardless of their individual system's specific path.
- Several additional libraries are used as part of the code, and may need to be installed. A list of these libraries is below.
- In the data folder, all datasets are cleaned or processed in some way unless they are in the 'raw' folder
